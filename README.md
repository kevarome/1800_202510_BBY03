## Technologies Used

For this project our team has chosen a variety of software and tools to bring the project to completion:
-HTML5 to present the content on the web. It’s widely supported across all browsers making the obvious choice for building web content.
-CSS to style and format the appearance of HTML elements on our web app. 
-JavaScript for the interactive web elements.
-Bootstrap provides a front-end framework for web development. It simplifies the process of building responsive and visually appealing websites -with a collection of ready-made HTML, CSS and JavaScript components.
-Trello as a project management tool to organize tasks for sprints.
-Discord for communication and file sharing.
-Figma for real-time collaboration on the design and prototyping for user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). 
-Firebase and Firestore as a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) to provide database, authentication, and hosting.
-Visual Studio Code as our main code editor.
-Github to host, share and collaborate on our project code repository. It is a convenient tool that allows us to track changes, revert to previous -versions and manage the project with multiple contributors.
We are using the memberships for the software that is readily available to students. No paid versions or subscriptions are being used.
